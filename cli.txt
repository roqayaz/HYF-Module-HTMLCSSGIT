1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
Use mkdir or touch to create file or folder and after that add a dot (.) at the beginning of the name.
To view hidden files, run the ls command with the -a flag which enables viewing of all files in a directory or -al flag for long listing.
2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
 By this code: mkdir -p myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message
To append messages to a file we use: 'echo "first message" >> CLI.txt' and  'echo "second message" >> CLI.txt'
